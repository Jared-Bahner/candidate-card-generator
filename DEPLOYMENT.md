3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Environment Variables in Vercel
```bash
vercel env add VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY
vercel env add VITE_APP_NAME
vercel env add VITE_APP_VERSION
vercel env add VITE_APP_ENV
```

### Netlify

#### Automatic Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Configure environment variables

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### GitHub Pages

#### Using GitHub Actions
1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Push to trigger automatic deployment

#### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Add, commit, and push dist folder
git add dist -f
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

- [ ] File uploads function properly
- [ ] AI services are accessible
- [ ] PDF generation works
- [ ] Recent cards save/load correctly

### ‚úÖ Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Bundle size < 2MB
- [ ] Images load quickly
- [ ] No console errors

### ‚úÖ Security Tests
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] API keys are not exposed
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Error messages don't leak information

### ‚úÖ Cross-Browser Tests
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile browsers

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Error Monitoring
Consider implementing:
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics for user behavior
- Performance monitoring

### Health Checks
- Set up uptime monitoring
- Configure error alerts
- Monitor API usage

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:run
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run preview &
      - run: sleep 10
      - run: curl -f http://localhost:4173 || exit 1
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (>= 18.0.0)
- Clear node_modules and reinstall
- Verify all dependencies are installed

#### Environment Variables
- Ensure all required variables are set
- Check variable names (case-sensitive)
- Verify API keys are valid

#### Performance Issues
- Analyze bundle size with `npm run build:analyze`
- Optimize images and assets
- Check for memory leaks

#### API Errors
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check API rate limits
- Ensure network connectivity

## üìû Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review build logs
3. Test locally first
4. Create an issue in the repository

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback
1. Revert to previous commit
2. Rebuild and redeploy
3. Verify functionality

### Database/Storage Rollback
